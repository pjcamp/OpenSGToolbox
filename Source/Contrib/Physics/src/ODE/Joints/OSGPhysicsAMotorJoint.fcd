    The current joint stop/motor implementation has a small problem: when the joint is at one stop and the motor is set to move it away from the stop, too much force may be applied for one time step, causing a jumping motion. This fudge factor is used to scale this excess force. It should have a value between zero and one (the default value). If the jumping motion is too visible in a joint, the value can be reduced. Making this value too small can prevent the motor from being able to move the joint away from a stop.

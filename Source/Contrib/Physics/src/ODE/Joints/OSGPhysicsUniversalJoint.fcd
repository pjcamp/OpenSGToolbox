    High stop angle or position. Setting this to dInfinity (the default value) turns off the high stop. For rotational joints, this stop must be less than pi to be effective. If the high stop is less than the low stop then both stops will be ineffective.

    The constraint force mixing (CFM) value used by the stops. Together with the ERP value this can be used to get spongy or soft stops. Note that this is intended for unpowered joints, it does not really work as expected when a powered joint reaches its limit.

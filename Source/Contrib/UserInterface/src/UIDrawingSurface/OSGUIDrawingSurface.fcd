    A virtual surface that a graphical user interface is drawn on.
    The drawing surface manages a set of OSG::InternalWindows.  The 
    UIDrawingSurface must be attached to an event producer to pass
    mouse, key, and update events to the OSG::InternalWindows it contains.

        The event producer used by this DrawingSurface.  The event producer must 
        produce mouse, key, and update events.  These events are processed and passed
        to the windows of this drawing surface.

        A functor object used for transforming the mouse coordinates.
        This is used by OSG::UIForeground and OSG::UIRectangle for transforming
        the mouse coordinates when the DrawingSurface is connected to them.

        A map of the cursors for the DrawingSurface.  The UIDrawinSurface will query the 
        WindowEventProducer it is attached to for the the current cursor type.  This is 
        used as the key for this Cursor map.  If there is no value for the given key, then
        no cursor is drawn.

    A specialized Geometry that can blend between static OSG::Geometry.

    Each possible geometry that can be blended (a morph target) must be specified.
    In addition, there is a base mesh which is used a reference or baseline for the blending operation.

    The result of a morph mesh is usually a linear combination of other meshes (whether they are static,
    skinned, or something else). These input meshes are called the morph targets. A major constraint is that
    the morph targets must all have the same set of vertices (even if they are in different positions).Therefore, all
    of the morph targets&apos; vertices elements must have the same structure. The
    combination of the morph targets can interpolate the data of any of the vertex attributes of the base and target meshes.

    OSG::Morph is specified as a base mesh, a set of other meshes, a set of weights, a method for combining them, and a set of vertex properties to interpolate.
    By default only the Positions attribute is interpolated.  You can add or remove vertex attributes to interpolate by changing the 
    MorphProperties field.  The MorphProperteis field uses the vertex attributes defined in OSG::Geometry.
